##  Why this presentation?

We have already seen / are using both **Vagrant** and **Docker** for local development. Why another technology?

Lando is made for headache-free, hassle free environments with no detailed knowledge required by users of the tool. One admin can create and manage for all.

Lando uses _one file_ to build the containers it needs, and this can live in your Git codebase. Makes it simple to manage.
